Notes
-----
This is only a beta version. Please do not spread it.
There is no help file included but it shouldn't be 
hard to get the idea.

You control the bricks with the arrow keys.

LEFT  ARROW : Move brick to the left
RIGHT ARROW : Move brick to the right
UP ARROW    : Rotate brick
DOWN ARROW  : Drop Brick

The game display is scalable so you should be able to adjust the 
window size to your liking.

This game was developed using gcc version 2.95.2 with mingw32. No
other development tools were used. 
If you find a bug, please report it to me and I will try to fix it.
This is my first attempt at writing a game for Windows 95, so don't be
surprised if you find many bugs.

Have fun with the game!
